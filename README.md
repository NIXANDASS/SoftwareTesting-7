### DATE: 05/11/2024                                                                          
### REGISTER NUMBER :  212222040109
### AIM: 
To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and test the test cases using Pytest.

### Algorithm:
1. Write the python program for addition of two numbers
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested should have assert keyword at the beginning
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_add.py”.
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is saved and type “pytest test_add.py” and run it.

### Program:
```
def fibR(n): 
if n==1 or n==2: 
return 1 
return fibR(n-1)+fibR(n-2) 
def test_fib_1_equals_1(): 
assert fibR(1) == 1 
def test_fib_2_equals_1(): 
assert fibR(2) == 1 
def test_fib_6_equals_8(): 
assert fibR(6) == 7
```

### Output:

### Result:
Thus, the python program for addition is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
